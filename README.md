# COVID-Quarantine-control-model-Julia

In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January
2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than
10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as
a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address
this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine
learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan
brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from
R(t) > 1 to R(t) < 1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures
in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case
count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented
in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and
such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such
as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting
results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan
towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective
reproduction number at R(t) < 1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine
measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) > 1. Thus, it may be wise to relax
quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the
quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.
