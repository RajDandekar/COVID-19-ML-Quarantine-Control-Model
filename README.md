# COVID-Quarantine-control-model-Julia

In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January
2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than
10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as
a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address
this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine
learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan
brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from
R(t) > 1 to R(t) < 1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures
in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case
count in Wuhan.
